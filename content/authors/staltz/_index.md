<!-- Hi, I come from Brazil, but never felt like a true Brazilian. Now, I live in Finland, where it's nice and cold. The Finnish culture also matches my personality well.

I currently work as an independent contractor, programming instructor, speaker, and donation-based open source developer. From 2013 to 2017 I worked as a Senior Web and Mobile Developer at Futurice. Prior to that, I worked on my own startup during one year building web discussion forum software.

I'm enthusiastic about reactive programming, functional programming, frontend, mobile, and the decentralized web. I have authored the Cycle.js framework, and have been a core contributor to RxJS. Currently, I am helping build an open source peer-to-peer social network with Scuttlebutt, while supporting my existing open source libraries like Cycle.js and others. -->
